# TrafficTap
Adds Source and Sink road types to CSL

I don't know much about programming in C#, so don't hesitate to comment.

Currently working to add a new road type to the list of roads.

Future:
1. Add road type
2. Figure out how vehicle spawns work
3. Figure out how to destroy vehicles with target building (length of road)
